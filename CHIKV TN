# Vector storing the initial number of people in each compartment (at timestep 0)
initial_state_values <- c (S = 46895568.5,   # the whole population apart from the ones that are serprevalent is susceptible to infection
                           I = 1,           # the epidemic starts with a single infected person
                           R = 25251460.5)           # there is prior immunity in the population
# Calculating the total population size N (the sum of the number of people in each compartment)
N <- 72147030

# Defining lambda as a function of beta and I:
lambda = 0.028

# Vector storing the parameters describing the transition rates in units of years^-1
parameters <- c(beta = 2020117,      # the infection rate, which acts on susceptibles (lambda=b *I/N)
                                     # since Lambda (FOI) is a given value from your model, you should put lambda as an input parameter and make the model estimate Beta using this input parameter.
